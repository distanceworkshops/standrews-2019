# Introductory workshop practical exercises

Here you can find the exercises for the practical sessions during the course. All content will remain here on the Distance website for future consultation.

## Practicals

Practicals are provided in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) (`.Rmd`) and PDF format. RMarkdown can be opened in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the file "knitted" into HTML or PDF.

Note that the practicals are designed to be run sequentially, files generated from previous analyses are loaded and used in subsequent analyses.

## Data sets

Data sets are incorporated as `RData` files in the R package `dsdata`.  In addition, data for practicals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 are also included as comma-separated values (CSV files) in the `dsdata` package.

## Problems

If you run into a problem running any of these examples, please report [an issue on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/distanceworkshops/standrews-2019/issues). Or contact the workshop instructors.
