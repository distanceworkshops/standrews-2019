# Practical exercises

Here you can find the exercises for the practical sessions during the course. All content will remain here on the Distance website for future consultation.

## Practicals

Practicals are provided in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) (`.Rmd`) format. RMarkdown can be opened in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the file "knitted" into HTML or PDF.

Note that the practicals are designed to be run sequentially, files generated from previous analyses are loaded and used in subsequent analyses.

## Data sets

Data for the practicals come in a variety of forms for analysis both in R and in Distance 7.

### Data for density surface modelling (Practicals 2-7)

To run the sperm whale analysis you'll need to download the following files, unzip them and store the unzipped folders in the same directory as the `Rmd` files for practicals 5-10 above:

- [Analysis.gdb](practicals/Analysis.gdb.zip)
- [Covariates_for_Study_Area.zip](practicals/Covariates_for_Study_Area.zip)

The Distance 7 project containing these data can be downloaded [from this location](practicals/spermwhale-Dist7.zip)

We'd like to thank Jason Roberts of Duke University for preparing these files in ArcGIS with the [MGET Toolbox](http://mgel2011-kvm.env.duke.edu/mget/).

### Data for double platform analysis (Practical 8)

For R users you just need the `csv` files:

- [Crabeater seals MRDS `csv`](practicals/crabbieMRDS.csv).
- [Crabeater seals MCDS `csv`](practicals/crabbieMCDS.csv).

For Distance for Windows users, project files can be downloaded here:

- [Crabbie MRDS Exercise Distance project](practicals/CrabbieMRDSExercise.zip)
- [Crabbie MCDS Exercise Distance project](practicals/CrabbieMCDSExercise.zip)
- [Golftees Exercise Distance project](practicals/GolfteesExercise.zip)


### Data for simulation (Practical 9)

[zip archive](practicals/simulation_exercise.zip) of R practical materials.

[Distance 7 projects](practicals/DSsim_distance_projects.zip) (`DSsimExercise` and `DSsimExerciseSolutions`).

## Problems

If you run into a problem running any of these examples, please report [an issue on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/distanceworkshops/stand-intermed-2018/issues). Or contact the workshop instructors.
