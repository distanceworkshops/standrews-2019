# Distance sampling in the Real World


- We've talked a lot about models
- We've also talked about assumptions
- Our example is relatively well-behaved
- What can we do about all the nasty real world stuff?


---

# Aims

- Here we want to cover common questions
- Not definitive answers
- Some guidance on where to look for answers

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# What should my sample size be?

---

# What do we mean by "sample size"?


- Number of animal (groups) recorded
  - *detection function*
- Number of segments
  - *spatial model*
- Number of segments with observations
  - *spatial model*

# Re-frame

---

# How would we know when we have enough samples?


- We don't
- Heavily context-dependent
- Go back to assumptions

# Pilot studies and "you get what you pay for"


- Designing surveys is hard
- Designing surveys is essential

- Better to fail one season than fail for 5, 10 years
- Get information early, get it cheap
  - Inform design from a pilot study


---

# Avoiding rules of thumb


- Think about assumptions
  - Detection function
  - Spatial model
- Think about design
  - Spatial coverage
  - Covariate coverage

# Sometimes things are complicated


- Weather has a big effect on detectability
- Need to record during survey
- Disambiguate between distribution/detectability
- Potential confounding can be BAD

- Sometimes you don't have enough data
- Or, enough coverage
- Or, the right covariates

# "Which of options X, Y, Z is correct?"

---

# Alternatives problem


- When faced with options, try them.
- **Where** does the sensitivity lie?
- What's **really** going on?
- What is your **objective**?

# "How big should our segments be?"

---


# Segment size


- If you think it's an issue test it
- Resolution of covariates also important
- Maybe species-/domain-dependent?
- (Solutions on the horizon to avoid this)

# "Is our model right?"

---


# Model validation


- Some variety of cross-validation
- Temporal replication
  - Leave out 1 year, fit to others, predict, assess
- Spatial "pseudo-jackknife"
  - Leave out every $n^{th}$ segment, refit, ...
  - (Maybe leave out 2, 3 etc...)

# Modelling philosophy


---

# Which covariates should we include?


- Dynamic vs static variables
- Spatial terms? Habitat models?

# Cyclic smooths


- What if things "wrap around"? (Time, angles, ...)
- Match value and derivative
- Use `bs="cc"`
- See `?smooth.construct.cs.smooth.spec`

# Smoothing in complex regions

.pull-left[
- Edges are important
- Whales don't live on land
- Bad things happen when we don't account for this
- Include boundary info in smoother 
- `?soap`
]

# Multivariate smooths


- Thin plate splines are *isotropic*
- 1 unit in any direction is equal
- Fine for space, not for other things


---

# Tensor products


- $s_{x,z}(x,z) = \sum_{k_1}\sum_{k_2} \beta_k s_x(x)s_z(z)$
- As many covariates as you like! (But takes time)
- `te()` or `ti()` (instead of `s()`)

# Random effects


- normal random effects
- exploits equivalence of random effects and splines `?gam.vcomp`
- useful when you just have a “few” random effects
- `?random.effects`

# Making things faster

---

# Parallel processing


- Some models are very big/slow
- Run on multiple cores
- Use `engine="bam"`!
- Some constraints in what you can do
- Wood, Goude and Shaw (2015)


---

# Summary


- Lots of complicated problems
- Lots of potential solutions
- (see also "other approaches" mini-lecture)
- Need to get simple things right first
- **Trade assumptions for data**
